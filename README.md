# ðŸš€ Welcome to Agent Domain Protocol!

## Vision

We believe that **websites as they are now will become a thing of the past**. The Agent Domain Protocol enables **AI agents** to interact through your **.Web3 domain**, acting on your behalf to negotiate, communicate, transact, and issue digital assets. Imagine your AI, trained based on your preferences, automatically engaging with other domains, finalizing deals, or executing transactions on-chainâ€”all while you focus on what matters most.

### ðŸ”¥ Intelligence Burned On-Chain: A Genuine, Tradable Asset

Unlike traditional domain services like ENS, BNS, or **.eth**, **3NS** integrates blockchain to **burn your intelligence on-chain**â€”embedding N8N-powered workflows and AI logic into your **.Web3 domain**. 

By using blockchain as a foundation, **intelligence merging, on-chain versioning, and rollback functionalities** become possible. Imagine your AI agent starts behaving unpredictably post-mergeâ€”blockchain auditing and rollback enable you to revert to the prior state with full accountability. Additionally, agents can autonomously **negotiate and pay** for services on your behalf, creating a frictionless, intelligent digital economy.

## ðŸŒŸ .Web3 Supports

### 1. **Web2 and Web3 Aggregation**
Your **.Web3 domain** combines Web2 and Web3, aggregating your social media, websites, and decentralized features like wallet addresses and smart contracts. It acts as a hub for both centralized and decentralized digital presence.

### 2. **True Ownership & Control**
Your **.Web3 domain** is decentralized and entirely under your control. It transcends traditional websites, serving as your unique digital identity.

### 3. **AI-Powered Agents**
Integrate advanced AI models to automate your digital presence. AI agents tied to your **.Web3 domain** can assist visitors, promote content, handle transactions, and even negotiate contracts.

### 4. **Decentralized Agent Management**
Choose from various AI modelsâ€”**OpenAI**, **Ollama**, **OpenWebUI**, or decentralized frameworks like **Fetch.ai**â€”to avoid lock-in and maintain control over your AI's evolution.

## Agent Domain Protocol (ADP)

Agent Domain Protocol (ADP) is an open-source standard for enabling AI-driven intelligence, discovery, and cross-chain workflows for .Web3 domains. It bridges the gap between decentralized naming systems and intelligent agents, providing a unified way to define, discover, and execute agent-based workflows.

## Domain Architecture

### Transforming Digital Assets

The **Domain Architecture** of ADP represents a significant leap forward in empowering digital assets across chains. Each domain is a tokenized, decentralized entity, embedded with a powerful ADP specification that defines its logic and functionality.  

1. **Multichain Registration**: Domains can be registered across multiple blockchains, ensuring interoperability and storing metadata like registries, transaction hashes, and timestamps.  
2. **Tokenized Collectives**: Domains support tokenization for decentralized decision-making, staking, and value-sharing.  
3. **Versioning, Merge, and Rollback**: Safeguard workflows with on-chain versioning, merging capabilities for combining intelligences, and blockchain-audited rollback functions.  
4. **Blockchain-Based Payments**: Agents can autonomously manage payments and escrow services, ensuring secure and seamless transactions.  

---

## Discovery and Reputation

ADP includes advanced discovery tools and decentralized reputation systems:  

1. **Agent Discovery**: Metadata like tags, workflow descriptors, and intent definitions enable efficient agent search.  
2. **Reputation Framework**: DID-based identities, verifiable credentials, and reputation scoring build trust among agents and users.
