# 🚀 Welcome to Web3names.ai | Secure Your .Web3 Domain Today!

At **Web3names.ai**, we believe that **websites are dead**. The future lies in **AI agents** that interact through your **.Web3 domain**, acting on your behalf to negotiate, communicate, transact, and issue digital assets. Imagine your AI, trained based on your preferences, automatically engaging with other domains, finalizing deals, or executing transactions on-chain—all while you focus on what matters most.

Your intelligence is gathered via websites, links, and documents. You train your agent, and it acts on your behalf. For example, agents tied to **jordans.nike.web3** can issue digital assets such as NFT sneakers, ensuring they are genuine and easily identifiable. In a world of fake news and AI-generated content, this verification of authenticity becomes increasingly crucial.

People can also interact with your AI agent through a browser. Your links are displayed, and they can chat with the AI you've trained, whether it’s for fans, customer support, or providing technical information.

### 🔥 Intelligence Burned On-Chain: A Genuine, Tradable Asset

Unlike traditional **.eth** or **.btc** addresses, **Web3names.ai** goes a step further by **burning your intelligence on-chain**, meaning your trained AI agent becomes an **immutable, tradable digital asset** tied to your **.Web3 domain**.

This process ensures that the intelligence and preferences you build into your AI agent are securely embedded into the blockchain. It cannot be tampered with or falsified, making it a **genuine source of truth** in a world rife with misinformation.

For example, imagine owning **Apple.web3**. The AI agent behind it, fully trained and embedded with Apple’s information and intelligence, could interact with users, answering queries about products, services, or support. Because the intelligence is burned on-chain, users can trust that the agent's responses are genuine and aligned with Apple’s brand.

This approach creates an ecosystem where your **.Web3 domain** is not just an identity but a **valuable, verifiable asset** that can be traded, sold, or transferred with its intelligence intact, elevating trust and reliability across Web3 interactions.
